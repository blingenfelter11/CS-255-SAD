# CS-255-

# Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

  Our client for this project was Liam, who is the owner of DriverPass. Liam would like our team to help build a web based system for booking driving lessons, taking practice test and providing online classes.
  
# What did you do particularly well?

  I feel like I did a good job breaking down the interview into actors and needs. I think I also did a good job providing information on how to meet the clients needs.
  
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  If I could choose one part of the projects to revise I would choose to revise some of my UML diagrams. With my continued reading on these diagrams I could improve them by adjusting how the information flow reads and making the information more understandable to the reader.
  
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

   To interpret the users needs I read through the DriverPass interview multiple times making notes of the actors and needs of the client for the project. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing a system for them in order to provide an end product that matches their vision of the system they desired we build for them.
   
# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  Depending on the type of systems the client is desiring we design I would choose between using a process model or a object model for the system. After collecting information on the actors and needs of the client I would design UML diagrams to illustrate how the system will function.
